CPARTED(8)
==========

NAME
----
cparted - Curses based disk partition manipulation program


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cparted* [_OPTION_] _DEVICE_PATH_


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*cparted* is a curses based disk partition manipulation program that aims to
replace cfdisk by providing a friendly curses interface with the partition
manipulation power of libparted. *cparted* is written in Python, and thus
makes use of libparted through pyparted.


OPTIONS
-------
*\--debug*::
    Start *cparted* in debug mode. This causes *cparted* to display extended,
    metadata, and protected partitions, and sets the default unit to sectors.


BUGS
----
Warning: this software has not been widely tested and has a least a few issues.

When creating primary partitions, there tend to be gaps of free
space between the partitions that are not usable. These gaps are typically
just smaller than the optimal alignment grain size of the HDD (or SSD). These
gaps may be hidden in a future release, but are left visible for now as the
author does not know if there is a proper way to get rid of them.

If the user creates a logical partition on a disk without any primary
partitions, two regions of free space may appear next to each other, and
writing to disk may corrupt the partition table. Creating a logical partition
without any primary partitions is allowed at this point, despite the known
issue, for testing reasons, and because there is no reason a user should not
be able to have a msdos partition table without primary partitions.
