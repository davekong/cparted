cparted - Curses based disk partition manipulation program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]cparted\f[] \f[I]device_path\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]cparted\f[] is a curses based disk partition manipulation
program that aims to replace cfdisk by providing a friendly curses
interface with the partition manipulation power of libparted.
\f[B]cparted\f[] is written in Python, and thus makes use of
libparted through pyparted.
.SH BUGS
.PP
WARNING: this software has not been widely tested and has a least a
few issues.
.PP
When creating primary partitions, there tend to be gaps of free
space between the partitions that are not usable.
These gaps are typically just smaller than the optimal alignment
grain size of the HDD (or SSD).
These gaps may be hidden in a future release, but are left visible
for now as the author does not know if there is a proper way to get
rid of them.
.PP
If the user creates a logical partition on a disk without any
primary partitions, two regions of free space may appear next to
each other, and writing to disk may corrupt the partition table.
Creating a logical partition without any primary partitions is
allowed at this point, despite the known issue, for testing
reasons, and because there is no reason a user should not be able
to have a msdos partition table without primary partitions.
